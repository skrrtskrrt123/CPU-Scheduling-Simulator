# CPU-Scheduling-Simulator (for Google Colab)
This simulator is designed to help users visualize and understand how various CPU scheduling algorithms work. It provides an interactive web-based interface built into Google Colab, allowing users to input process data and view scheduling results in real time using Gantt charts and performance metrics.

# how to run this project
1. Open the code in Google Colab.
2. Run the cell to initialize the Python backend and load the HTML interface.
3. Input the number of processes (make sure to press the 'Generate Process Fields' button) and their respective Arrival Time, Burst Time, and Priority values.
4. Select one of the available scheduling algorithms:
   - Round Robin (RR)
   - Shortest Job Next (SJN)
   - Priority (Non-preemptive)
   - Shortest Remaining Time (SRT)
5. If using RR, specify a quantum value.
6. Click “Run Simulation” to generate the Gantt chart and process statistics.
